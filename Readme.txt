A weather website built with HTML and CSS is a website that provides users with current weather information and forecasts for a specific location. The website is built using the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) which is the standard markup language for creating web pages and the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) which is used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML.

The HTML is used to create the structure and content of the website, such as the text, images, and links. The CSS is used to control the layout and design of the website, such as the colors, fonts, and spacing.
